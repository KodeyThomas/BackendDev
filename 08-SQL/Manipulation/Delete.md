# Delete

The DELETE FROM statement deletes one or more rows from a table. You can use the statement when you want to delete existing records. The statement below deletes all records in the celeb table with no twitter_handle:

```sql
DELETE FROM celebs
WHERE twitter_handle IS NULL;
```

- DELETE FROM is a clause that lets you delete rows from a table.

- celebs is the name of the table we want to delete rows from.

- WHERE is a clause that lets you select which rows you want to delete. Here we want to delete all of the rows where the twitter_handle column IS NULL.

- IS NULL is a condition in SQL that returns true when the value is NULL and false otherwise.
