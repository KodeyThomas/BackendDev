# Alter

The ALTER TABLE statement adds a new column to a table. You can use this command when you want to add columns to a table. The statement below adds a new column twitter_handle to the celebs table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE celebs
ADD COLUMN twitter_handle TEXT;
```

1. ALTER TABLE is a clause that lets you make the specified changes.
2. celebs is the name of the table that is being changed.
3. ADD COLUMN is a clause that lets you add a new column to a table:

- twitter_handle is the name of the new column being added
- TEXT is the data type for the new column

4. NULL is a special value in SQL that represents missing or unknown data. Here, the rows that existed before the column was added have NULL (∅) values for twitter_handle.
