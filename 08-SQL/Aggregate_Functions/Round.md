# Round

By default, SQL tries to be as precise as possible without rounding. We can make the result table easier to read using the ROUND() function.

ROUND() function takes two arguments inside the parenthesis:

- a column name
- an integer

It rounds the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer.

```sql
SELECT ROUND(price, 0) FROM fake_apps;
```

Here, we pass the column price and integer 0 as arguments. SQL rounds the values in the column to 0 decimal places in the output.
