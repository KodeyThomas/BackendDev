# Max / Min

The MAX() and MIN() functions return the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.

How many downloads does the most popular app have?

```sql
SELECT MAX(downloads) FROM fake_apps;
```

The most popular app has 31,090 downloads!

- MAX() takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the largest value in that column. Here, we returned the largest value in the downloads column.

- MIN() works the same way but it does the exact opposite; it returns the smallest value.
