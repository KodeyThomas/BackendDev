- [Hacker Times](#hacker-times)
- [Lyft Ride Data](#lyft-ride-data)

### First Project

In this Project it's really simple and just gives me a basic understanding of different operations in SQL

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/08-SQL/Projects/firstProject.sqlite)

### Query Project

This Project I applied my skills on Querying SQL databases using all the different key words and commands, by following an example given to me for example

```UTF-8
Create a Top 10 Restaurants Ranking Based on Reviews
```

Then I would do;

```sql
SELECT * FROM nomnom ORDER BY review DESC LIMIT 10;
```

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/08-SQL/Projects/queryProject.sqlite)

### Aggregate Functions 

In this Project I demonstrate my knowledge of Aggregate Functions within SQL

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/08-SQL/Projects/aggregateFunctions.sqlite)

### Hacker Times

This example project uses queries on a example hacker_times database to query the database

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/08-SQL/Projects/hacker_times.sqlite)

### Lyft Ride Data

This Project demonstrated my abilities to use queries to join tables together in various ways
