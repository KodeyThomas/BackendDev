# SQL Projects

This file contains all SQL Projects that i've done on codecademy

- [First Project](#first-project)
- [Query Project](#query-project)
- [Aggregate Fuinctions](#aggregate-functions)

### First Project

In this Project it's really simple and just gives me a basic understanding of different operations in SQL

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/08-SQL/Projects/firstProject.sql)

### Query Project

This Project I applied my skills on Querying SQL databases using all the different key words and commands, by following an example given to me for example

```UTF-8
Create a Top 10 Restaurants Ranking Based on Reviews
```

Then I would do;

```sql
SELECT * FROM nomnom ORDER BY review DESC LIMIT 10;
```

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/08-SQL/Projects/queryProject.sql)

### Aggregate Functions 

In this Project I demonstrate my knowledge of Aggregate Functions within SQL
