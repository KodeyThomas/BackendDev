# Or

Similar to AND, the OR operator can also be used to combine multiple conditions in WHERE, but there is a fundamental difference:

AND operator displays a row if all the conditions are true.
OR operator displays a row if any condition is true.
Suppose we want to check out a new movie or something action-packed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year > 2014 OR genre = 'action';
```

- year > 2014 is the 1st condition.

- genre = 'action' is the 2nd condition.

- OR combines the two conditions.

With OR, if any of the conditions are true, then the row is added to the result.
