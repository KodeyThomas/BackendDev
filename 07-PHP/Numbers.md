# Numbers in PHP

PHP is a weak type language which means you don't need to declare variable types within your code

PHP has two number based Data Types and they are `integer` and `floating point` which are the two main ones used in every language so not much different

There isn't much to say on this topic apart from it has the same standard set of Maths Operators + - / * % **

PHP uses BODMAS when working out Mathematical Operations so keep that in mind
