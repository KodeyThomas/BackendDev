# Introduction To PHP

PHP is incredibly flexible and can be executed from the terminal, it can also be used as a general purpose programming language without involving HTML

When writing PHP we still need to denote we are beginning our PHP code using `<?php` just like in HTML. However the closing tag is not needed and usually left out my convention

Again, like a lot of other languages PHP generally ignores whitespace so every command needs to be finished with a semi-colon `;`

Weirdly however unlike a lot of other languages PHP is not always case-sensitive so `Echo` is a valid statement but so is `echo`

### Comments

Just like in HTML, JavaScript and Golang. The way you do comments is exactly the same you use the `//` keyword and to do multi-line comments `/* */`
