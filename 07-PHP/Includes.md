# Includes in PHP

Includes are a massively important feature within any Programming Language as it allows you to import code from other Files / Libraries which can massively improve how quickly you code something

For example if you want a Library to implement REST API calls easier you can look for an Open Source one that runs super fast

### How do I use an include then?

It's super simple and all you do is use the keyword `include` followed by the filename. Simple!

```php
include 'filename.php;
```

Done!
