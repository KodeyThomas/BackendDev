### World Traveller

This is the first Project I've made with Codecademy and the Project combines all I've learn within the first hour or so. 

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/07-PHP/Projects/world-traveller.php)

### Mad Lib Functions

In this project, I demonstrated my learning in PHP with a simple project that uses functions. 

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/07-PHP/Projects/mad-lib-functions.php)

### Bob's Budget

This is a more complex project which heavily uses arrays and nested arrays to create a budget tracker for bob's money. 

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/07-PHP/Projects/bobs-budget.php)

### Calculator

In this project, we start to apply more practical PHP skills like including HTML forms and slowly integrating it into a more useable use case
