### World Traveller

This is the first Project I've made with Codecademy and the Project combines all I've learn within the first hour or so. 

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/07-PHP/Projects/world-traveller.php)

### Mad Lib Functions

In this project, I demonstrated my learning in PHP with a simple project that uses functions. 

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/07-PHP/Projects/mad-lib-functions.php)

### Bob's Budget

This is a more complex project which heavily uses arrays and nested arrays to create a budget tracker for bob's money. 

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/07-PHP/Projects/bobs-budget.php)

### Calculator

In this project, we start to apply more practical PHP skills like including HTML forms and slowly integrating it into a more useable use case

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/07-PHP/Projects/Caclulator)

### Magic 8 Ball

This project is another example of using Conditionals, in this case a switch statement. It's pretty simple but still an applied example of what I've learnt

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/07-PHP/Projects/magic-8-ball.php)

### Number Guesser

In this Project I use input from the user to make my program more dynamic

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/07-PHP/Projects/number-guesser.php)

### Text Based Adventure Game

This project took a lot longer due to the shear size of it, that being said it probably took ~1hour so not too long at all

This project uses absolutely everything I've learnt in PHP up to this point and I've really enjoyed doing it!
