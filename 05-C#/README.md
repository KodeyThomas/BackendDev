# C#

So I'm currently as of writing enrolled in an apprenticeship, which for my qualification at the end of it requires me to learn C#

### What is C#

C# is a multi purpose programming language created by Microsoft in 2002, with its original purpose to be designed for building windows applications. However later due to it's growth in popularity several library's and extensions have come out allowing for more versatile development across a wide array of platforms.

### Why am I learning C#

Partly it's to do with it being a requirement for my Apprenticeship. However it's also another tool I can learn and understand which will help incase my job ever requires me to build and develop Desktop applications. It's unlikely but I would like to have some baseline knowledge as well to add to my skillset.

### How I'm going to be learning C#

I shall be learning C# through my Apprenticeship skills provider but also on my own in my spare time. To learn a new language personally I love chucking myself in the deep end by watching a few tutorials and then cracking on with a project. This is due to the fact quite a few languages are similar just the syntax is different but the overall concepts remain the same.

A few resources I shall be using along the way are. 
- [Codecademy's C# Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-sharp)
- [Microsoft's C# Learning Kit](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/csharp)
- [Stackoverflow (To get quick answers on specific topics)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/csharp)
- Various Youtube Tutorials

### How it stacks up against other languages I know

C# is a fairly unique language but it stems from the language C (If you couldn't tell from the name). The other language I know that stems from C is Objective-C which is a language exclusively used to develop iOS apps and Tweaks. I have a fair level of knowledge of Objective-C and understand the fact they are two completely different languages as C# takes more inspiration from Java then C. However some of the concepts are the same so it shouldn't be too bad getting a basic understanding of how the language works.

I also know [JavaScript](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/01-JavaScript) so that should also come in handy as a few concepts transfer over.

### What I am going to learn.

As a bit of a Flowchart / Pretty looking diagram kinda guy myself linked [HERE](https://infinite.education/expertise/junior_csharp_programmer) is an amazing little roadmap of some of the topics I want to cover as I learn C#. Most of them are irrelevant as they take into account someone trying to become a Junior Dev. in any language but I am going to focus on the C# specific ones.

These include:

- Basic Concepts
- Variables
- C# Data Types
- Exceptions
- Classes 
- Namespaces
