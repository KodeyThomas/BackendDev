Inside this folder contains some basic C# Projects I will work on time to time while completing my apprenticeship.

Inside this `ReadMe` will give you a basic overview of what the project is, How I made it and What I learnt.

In this First Project I Created, It's incredibly simple. It Prints `Hello World!` but to make it a tiny bit more complex it stores the String containing `Hello World!` in a different `class` in a different file.

The reason I did this is to start off learning about making code easier to read and learning about using different `classes` within a project.

The Project only took < 5 Minutes to complete.
