# Virtual Private Cloud

A VPC is a unique tool for us in AWS it allows us to isolate a section from the outside world and configure all of our resources within it.

We can assign our VPC's IP Range using CIDR notation, within our VPC we can provision resources to work within the isolated space. This allows us to combine multiple AWS Services together and use them to create our custom architecture for our needs.

Think of it like a container which we can put all our datacentre stuff in.
