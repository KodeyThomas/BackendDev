# JavaScript Basics

Following the roadmap, the first language I need to learn is `JavaScript`

### What is JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level programming language with applications from Front End development in Web Design all the way through to Node.JS for Backend Development

### Why am I learning JavaScript

JS is a incredibly versatile language and will help me no matter what branch of Development I choose to pursue due to that fact JS is an incredibly in-demand language for Developers and according to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is the most commonly used language by Professional Developers. Additionally with JS you can learn more advanced aspects of programming such as [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). JS also allows you to be able to use powerful frameworks such as [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) with the later being what [Discord](https://discord.com) uses as it is incredibly versatile and works cross-platform.

### How am I going to learn JavaScript

I am going to be using several online tools with the main one going to be [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) due to the fact the free course material is incredibly good and I have previously used it.

### Course Syllabus

This JS Course will take roughly **30 Hours** to complete and will give you a fundamental understanding of the language
