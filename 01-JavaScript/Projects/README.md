# JavaScript Projects

In this folder contains various JavaScript project's I've worked on.

These are mainly from Codecademy's online course but there will be (probably at a later date) other project's I've worked on.

### Projects

- [Kelvin Weather](#kelvin-weather)

#### Kelvin Weather

Kelvin Weather is a stupidly simple project and is the first one you complete on the course. It starts of simple my making you apply your knowledge of `console.log`,`Math.Floor` and `Variables`

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/01-JavaScript/Projects/kelvin_weather.js)

#### Dog Years

Dog Years is another simple project and just helps reinforce your learning about variables and working with maths operators
