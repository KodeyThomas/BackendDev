# Projects Completed In Phase 1 

This folder details the projects I have completed during Phase 1 of learning Go

- [ASCII Art](#ascii-art)
- [Comic Book](#comic-book)

### ASCII Art

In this Project, I created a stupidly simple program in Go which prints out some ASCII Art. Thats literarily it...

Codecademy made me do it... So I did it

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/06-GoLang/Phase_1/Projects/asciiArt.go)

### Comic Book

This Project creates a simple catalog of Comic Books and uses Variables and Data Types along with the built-in Package `fmt` to print out the details about the Comic Book
