# Projects Completed In Phase 1 

This folder details the projects I have completed during Phase 1 of learning Go

- [ASCII Art](#ascii-art)
- [Comic Book](#comic-book)
- [Bank Heist](#bank-heist)
- [Interstellar Travel](#interstellar-travel)

### ASCII Art

In this Project, I created a stupidly simple program in Go which prints out some ASCII Art. Thats literarily it...

Codecademy made me do it... So I did it

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/06-GoLang/Phase_1/Projects/asciiArt.go)

### Comic Book

This Project creates a simple catalog of Comic Books and uses Variables and Data Types along with the built-in Package `fmt` to print out the details about the Comic Book

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/06-GoLang/Phase_1/Projects/comicbook.go)

### Bank Heist

This Project was a simulation of a Bank Heist, It used conditionals and random number generation (Including Seeding to make more random numbers) to create the outcome of the game

The seeding worked by getting the current UNIX time and using that to seed for our random number so overtime we played the game it was *relatively* random

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/06-GoLang/Phase_1/Projects/bankHeist.go)

### Interstellar Travel

This was the final project for me to complete on Codecademy, it is a combination of all the skills in Go I have learnt up until this point.

It uses multiple Conditional Statements, Functions (With Input Parameters and expected Return values)

Code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/BackendDev/tree/master/06-GoLang/Phase_1/Projects/interstellarTravel.go)
